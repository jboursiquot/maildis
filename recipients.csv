We take pride in not hiding costs behind unexpected bugs throughout the project. Some people think that it is inherent for software to have bugs. We don't buy into that philosophy, and although we do of course deal with bugs from time to time, we use a strict process to keep our quality standards impossibly high."
Anna Hardy,josh@supervillains.io,https://calendly.com/josh-jordan/15min?email=anne@workrise.com&full_name=Anna Hardy,"I understand that you had worked with Pieoneers in the past and weren't completely satisfied. We have built our business around US-based developers to keep our quality impossibly high. We don't hide costs behind bugs and change requests. Philosophically, we agree with you: clients should not ever pay extra for work that was already agreed upon. We go very far to make sure that our clients are happy with our work because we want build long-term relationships."
